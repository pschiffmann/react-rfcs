# Summary

The `useForEach` hook provides a sane mechanism for calling React Hooks inside loops.

# Basic example

The `useForEach(keys, callback)` hook calls `callback` once for each element in the `keys` iterable.
The `callback` function is allowed to call hooks, as if it was at the top level of the component.

```ts
import { useEffect, useForEach, useMemo, useState } from "react";

const results = useForEach(keys, (key) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(/* ... */);
  useEffect(/* ... */);
  return useMemo(/* ... */);
});
```

# Motivation

Once you have learned to think in React, synchronizing a single external system with React is simple, sane and straight-forward.
The `useSyncExternalStore` and `useEffect` hooks let you subscribe to a single external state, or allocate and clean-up a single resource, respectively.
The hooks have clear semantics and a predictable lifecycle
predictable, easy to reason about, colocating allocation and cleanup,

`useEffect` is an excellent/genius API because predictable, colocating. We want these attributes also for managing array of external resources, but the hook doesn't work that way

React provides several hooks that deal with a single piece of data.

- `useEffect` synchronizes a single external resource with React.
- `useMemo` and `useCallback` memoize a single value.
- `useId` allocates a single document-wide unique id.

But when an applications has to deal with an array of such data, React doesn't offer a canonical solution.

---

Two ubiquitous refactoring tasks we encounter in almost every React application are: [lifting state up](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components), and [synchronizing with effects](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects).
But applying both refactorings _at the same time_ (i.e. lifting effects up) can be surprisingly difficult.

## ChatRooms example

We can observe these problems when trying to build a

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51aa4c0d-7cb5-442d-a4d4-2eafe7ce0f60" />

Integrating a single chat room connection with a React application is pretty straight-forward, and is covered in great detail in the [Lifecycle of React Effects](https://react.dev/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects) chapter.

This code snippet is taken from the [Lifecycle of React Effects](https://react.dev/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects) chapter, slightly altered with a `useState()` hook to give the component access to the connection object.

```tsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const connection = useSingleConnection(roomId);
  // ...
}

function useSingleConnection(roomId) {
  const [conn, setConn] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId);
    setConn(connection);
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
      setConn(null);
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  return conn;
}
```

Now, imagine we want to extend our chat app, and support connecting to multiple chat rooms at the same time.
We want to render a [tabs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) component where each chat room is displayed with a tab.

```tsx
function ChatApp({ rooms }) {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(0);
  return (
    <Tabs
      labels={rooms.map((room) => room.name)}
      activeTab={activeTab}
      onTabChange={(i) => setActiveTab(i)}
    >
      <ChatRoom roomId={rooms[activeTab].id} />
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

Finally, if there are unread messages in a chatroom, we want to show a badge on that tab.
Assuming we can read this information from the connection object, then we need to lift the state up â€“ the connections must be moved from the `ChatRoom` to the `ChatApp`.

Ideally, we could just use a loop in `ChatApp` to iterate over `rooms`, like this:

```tsx
function ChatApp({ rooms }) {
  const connections = rooms.map((room) => useSingleConnection(room.id));
  // ...
}
```

However, this is forbidden by the [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks).
Instead, we have to move the loop inside the effect.

```tsx
function useMultipleConnections(roomIds) {
  const [conns, setConns] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const connections = roomIds.map((roomId) => createConnection(roomId));
    setConns(connections);
    return () => {
      connections.forEach((connection) => connection.disconnect());
      setConns([]);
    };
  }, [roomIds]);
  return conns;
}
```

But this is still not perfect.
Whenever the user connects to a new chatroom, or even just reorders their rooms list, this code closes and re-opens all connections.
This can cause flashing UI elements, and child components possibly losing state or re-triggering their own effects.

To work around this issue, we either need to use some non-idiomatic React Ref trickery; or move the connection management out of React and into our own state management solution.
In any case, we lose the clean React semantics and lifecycle guarantees that `useEffect` provides.

## With `useForEach()`

Idiomatic React is all about _composition_.
Ideally, we want to compose the `useMultipleConnections()` hook from the existing `useSingleConnection()` hook.
The `useForEach()` hook is one possible API design to achieve this goal.

```tsx
function ChatApp({ rooms }) {
  const roomIds = rooms.map((room) => room.id);
  const connections = useForEach(roomIds, (roomId) =>
    useSingleConnection(room.id)
  );
  // ...
}
```

The hook can effectively be used to convert any hook that manages a single state, effect or resource, into a hook that manages an array of said state, effects or resources.

# Detailed design

## Reference

```tsx
import { type Key } from "react";

declare function useForEach<K extends Key, T>(
  keys: Iterable<K>,
  callback: (key: K) => T
): readonly T[];
```

### Parameters

- `keys`: The iterable on which the loop operates.
  It should contain only strings and/or numbers, and should not contain duplicates.

  The iterable should be a dynamic value and come from e.g. props or another hook call.
  This is not a dependency array like for the `useMemo` or `useEffect` hooks, and should not be an array literal.

- `callback`: The function that is executed for each element in `keys`.
  It should be pure, should take a single `key` argument, and may return a value of any type.
  It may call other React Hooks.

  Hooks that are called inside `callback` use the passed-in `key` to track their state across multiple renders.
  For example, a `useState` hook will always return the state for the same key, even if that key moves to different indexes in the `keys` iterable over multiple renders.
  Likewise, a `useEffect` hook will compare the current dependencies with the previous dependencies of the same key to determine whether to execute again.

  If `keys` contains a new key that wasn't present in the previous render, then the Hooks for that key will be newly initialized, like it normally happens during the first render of a component.
  For example, `useMemo` will call its `calculateValue` callback, because there are no previous dependencies to compare yet.

  If `keys` doesn't contain a key that was present in the previous render, then the Hooks associated with that key are "unmounted".
  Effect hooks like `useEffect` and `useSyncExternalStore` execute their cleanup; stateful hooks like `useState`, `useMemo` and `useRef` drop all references to their values.
  When that same key appears again in a subsequent render, then it gets newly initialized again.

### Returns

A frozen array containing the results from calling `callback` with all `keys`.

The order of values inside the results array matches the order of `keys`.
For example, if `keys` is `[1, 2, 3]` during one render and `[2, 1, 3]` during the next, then the first results array will be `[callback(1), callback(2), callback(3)]`, and the second will be `[callback(2), callback(1), callback(3)]`.

React will return the same array during consecutive renders, if the number of keys hasn't changed, each index in the results array contains the same value as during the previous render (as determined by `Object.is`).
To prevent inadvertent mutations that would leak into consecutive renders, the results array is [frozen](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze).

## Usage

### Executing an effect for each element in an array

To execute an effect for each element in an array, wrap the `useEffect` call with `useForEach`.

```tsx
function ChatApp({ roomIds }) {
  useForEach(roomIds, (roomId) => {
    useEffect(() => {
      const connection = createConnection(roomId);
      return () => {
        connection.close();
      };
    }, [roomId]);
  });
}
```

You can think of this code as being equivalent to this:

```tsx
function ChatApp({ roomIds }) {
  for (const roomId of roomIds) {
    useEffect(() => {
      const connection = createConnection(roomId);
      return () => {
        connection.close();
      };
    }, [roomId]);
  }
}
```

The second code listing (with the `for ... of` loop) is not valid React code, because it violates the [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks).
The first code listing (with the `useForEach` hook) is valid React code, follows the Rules of Hooks, and achieves the same goal.

### Associating state with keys

If you need to store some state for each of your keys, you have two options.

1. You can store the state for each key inside a separate state hook, like this:

   ```tsx
   function ChatApp({ roomIds }) {
     const connections = useForEach(roomIds, (roomId) => {
       const connections = useEffect(() => {
         const [conn, setConn] = useState(null); // <- State variable that stores a single connection object.
         const connection = createConnection(roomId);
         setConn(connection); // <- Write to the local state variable.
         return () => {
           connection.close();
           setConn(null);
         };
       }, [roomId]);
       return conn; // <- Pass the local variable to the parent scope.
     });
   }
   ```

   Call `useState` inside the `useForEach` callback to create a local state variable.
   Write to that state within the effect, and return the state from the callback function.
   `useForEach` returns an array of all the callback results.

   To find the connection corresponding to a specific key, check the results array at that same index:

   ```tsx
   for (let i = 0; i < roomIds.length; i++) {
     const roomId = roomIds[i];
     const connection = connections[i];
   }
   ```

2. Alternatively, you can store all values in a single state variable, inside a [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) or object.

   ```tsx
   function ChatApp({ roomIds }) {
     const [connections, setConnections] = useState({}); // <- State variable that stores all connections.
     useForEach(roomIds, (roomId) => {
       const connections = useEffect(() => {
         const connection = createConnection(roomId);
         setConnections((prev) => ({ ...prev, [roomId]: connection })); // <- Write to the component-level state.
         return () => {
           connection.close();
           setConnections(([roomId]: _, ...rest) => rest);
         };
       }, [roomId]);
       // No `return` needed here.
     });
   }
   ```

   To find the connection corresponding to a specific key, index the map by that key:

   ```tsx
   for (const roomId of roomIds) {
     const connection = connections[roomId];
   }
   ```

Option 1 gives you an array of values, where the element order is guaranteed to match the `keys` order of the current render.
Option 2 gives you a map from key to value, but the iteration order of the map may get out of sync with the `keys` iteration order over time.
Which option is better depends on your use case.

## Corner cases

### Exception handling

The `useForEach` hook does not catch errors.
When `callback` throws an error, it will bubble up and terminate the current render.
This follows the example established by the `useMemo` callback and `useState` initializer callback.

### Duplicate keys

Passing a `keys` iterable that contains duplicate values triggers a [duplicate keys](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/a4964987dc140526702e996223fe7ee293def8ac/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactChildFiber.js#L1070-L1077) error.
The error is logged to `console.error` in development, and silently discarded in production.

For duplicate keys, React tries to match loop `callback` calls to hook state via the iteration index.
If matching based on the index fails, the loop "instances" of the duplicate keys and the associated Hooks become "orphaned".
Orphaned state hooks can be garbage collected because they can never be read again, and orphaned effect hooks will never execute their cleanup function.
See [Appendix A: React handling of duplicate keys in JSX](#appendix-a-react-handling-of-duplicate-keys-in-jsx) for a demonstration of this behaviour for JSX elements.

This follows the example established by JSX keys.

### Key type coercion

To determine key equality, the `useForEach` hook internally converts all elements in the `keys` array to strings.
All of the following arrays will trigger a duplicate keys error:
`["1", 1]`, `[{}, {}]`, `["null", null]`
This follows the example established by JSX keys.

## Sharing state between iterations

```tsx
function useMultipleConnections(roomIds) {
  const [connections, setConnections] = useState({});
  useForEach(roomIds, (roomId) => {
    useEffect(() => {
      const connection = createConnection(roomId);
      setConnections((prev) => ({ ...prev, [roomId]: connection }));
      return () => {
        connection.disconnect();
        setConn((prev) => {
          const { [roomId]: _, ...rest } = { ...prev };
          return rest;
        });
      };
    }, [roomId]);
  });
  return connections;
}
```

# Drawbacks

Foot gun - this hook is powerful, and as such requires a certain level of care and understanding to use properly.
Improper use can cause problems like:

- performance issues due to excessive hook calls
- memory leaks

The issue is even greater here than with JSX arrays because this hook will probably be used almost exclusively for effects.
Maybe this complexity should not be made more accessible, and should be left to experienced engineers who build solutions outside of React.

Why should we _not_ do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- the impact on teaching people React
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating existing React applications (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

## Appendix A: React handling of duplicate keys in JSX

This appendix demonstrates how React handles duplicate keys in JSX arrays.
Before we look at the duplicate keys case, we first examine a well-behaving program.

const cleanupsRun = { Z: 0, A: 0, B: 0, C: 0 };

export function App() {
  const [hidden, setHidden] = useState(true);
  const [n, setN] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    console.table({ effectsRun, cleanupsRun });
  });

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setHidden(!hidden)}>
        {hidden ? "show" : "hide"}
      </button>{" "}
      <button onClick={() => setN((n + 1) % 4)}>{"Z >> 1"}</button>
      {!hidden &&
        [
          <Child key="A" value="A" />,
          <Child key="B" value="B" />,
          <Child key="C" value="C" />,
        ].toSpliced(n, 0, <Child key="Z" value="Z" />)}
    </>
  );
}

function Child({ value }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    effectsRun[value]++;
    return () => {
      cleanupsRun[value]++;
    };
  });
  return <div>{value}</div>;
}
```

</details>

The "show/hide" button mounts/unmounts a list of four children `A`, `B`, `C`, `Z`.
The "Z >> 1" button moves the `Z` child to the next position in the list, wrapping around after the last position.

The children run an effect after every render, and a cleanup before their next render (or unmount).
The devtools table displays how often each effect and cleanup function is run.
We can see that effects run once per render, and all effects are cleaned up again.

To observe how React handles duplicate keys, we give the children `A`, `B` and `C` the same key.

```diff
      {!hidden &&
        [
          <Child key="A" value="A" />,
-         <Child key="B" value="B" />,
-         <Child key="C" value="C" />,
+         <Child key="A" value="B" />,
+         <Child key="A" value="C" />,
        ].toSpliced(n, 0, <Child key="Z" value="Z" />)}

</details>

We can see that React doesn't properly unmount all elements, and also doesn't run all effect cleanup callbacks.
In a real application, this can lead to UI glitches with duplicated UI elements, and possibly memory leaks due to external resources that are allocated but never cleaned up.
